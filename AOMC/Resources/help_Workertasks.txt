This list shows worker tasks.
"Maprect" is the map rectangle value provided to AO. 
  This has to be provided manually, and cannot be autogenerated, because it depends on the MapCoords.xml.

Layers - these are images processed by each worker.
  You will only be able to assign an image to a single worker. This is because there's no point adding the same image twice.
  Add multiple images to a single worker to have it "compare" them, and only add unique slices.
    All the compared images dimensions should be the same width & height.
    When comparing images, the width and height must be consistent between them. Otherwise, there may be unforseen errors with the map.
  Add a single image to the worker if there's no other images similar to it.
