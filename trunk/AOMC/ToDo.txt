When renaming image names:
	update image references in worktask layers.
When renaming layer names:
	update layer references in text files.
	
When loading a map config, check:
	duplicate image names
	duplicate image paths
	duplicate layer names
	duplicate worker names
	duplicate textfile names
	
When tossing map configuration to compiler, toss a copy - not a reference.
	We don't want the compiling library to modify the original map configuration.
