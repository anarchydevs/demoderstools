How to calculate MapRect vs MapCoordinates.xml:
	1: If there are any "base" values to substract from MapCoords.xml values, it's equal between SL and RK.
		 It's more likely that these 'boundary' values have to be calculated from MapRect.

Potential compile-time saver:
	Implement pre-sliced image, so that the map compiler doesn't have to slice a huge image every time it's compiled. (would improve on overall memory usage as well) (suggestion by Xyphos)
